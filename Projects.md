# Key Projects

## PCIe Validation Automation Framework
- Developed Python-based automation tools to interface with lab instruments (oscilloscopes, PCIe analyzers, JTAG).
- Automated system-level stress, throughput, and regression testing of Broadcom chipsets.
- Reduced silicon validation cycles by 30% through streamlined test orchestration and data integration.

## Real-Time Register Monitor
- Created an asynchronous Python tool to monitor SoC registers in real-time using JTAG and XML-based register maps.
- Implemented auto-triggering and decoding to identify link training and hardware issues faster.
- Enabled faster root cause analysis and debugging during chip bring-up.

## Data-Driven Bug Analysis Tool
- Designed Python analytics pipelines using Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze silicon test failures.
- Visualized bug trends and failure modes, reducing root cause isolation time by 25%.
- Provided interactive reports and dashboards to validation teams.

## Customer Feedback NLP Analytics (Personal Project)
- Built an NLP platform using Python and AWS Lambda for sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
- Developed RESTful APIs with FastAPI and delivered interactive dashboards with QuickSight.
- Automated end-to-end data ingestion, processing, and visualization workflows.
